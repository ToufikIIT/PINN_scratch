# PINN_scratch
This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) from scratch using NumPy to solve ODE  The network computes all derivatives manually (no autograd) and trains using a physics loss + boundary condition loss. The final prediction is compared to the exact analytical solution.
